Custom picker view with floating balloon animation

## Requirements

- iOS 10.0+
- Xcode 10

## Installation

Just copy contents of `balloonPicker` folder to your project

## Usage

Instantiate `BalloonPickerView` and add it to your view, or set to custom class of view in storyboard.
Use target-action event `valueChanged` to track value changes.

To customize balloon behavior you can instantiate `BalloonView` and set custom background image (see example), inherit your own class from it, or even create your own view conforming to `ProgressTracking` protocol (size of balloon is dermined by `intrinsicContentSize` property, so do not forget to return appropriate value).

Do not set `clipToBounds = true` for picker view.
